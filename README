This started as an initiative to learn noweb literate-programming tools, see
README-orig for more details.

Right now the idea is to boostrap noweb from all original noweb v2.12
documents (.nw files) using nofake (included).

The self contained build system should depend only on a standard
bourne shell, nawk and a standard make (e.g. bmake).

Please consider this a work in progress.

Please note that this is a derived work and is not maintained by
