this started as an initiative to learn noweb literate-programming tools, see
README-orig for more details

right now the idea is to boostrap noweb from all original noweb v2.12
documents (.nw files) using nofake (included).

contrib and examples were not added yet and the self contained build system
should depend only on a bourne shell, nawk and a standard make (e.g. bmake)

please consider this a work in progress
