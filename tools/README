These files are part of a simple, self contained build system, you shouldn't
depend on extenal tools except:

    - a bourne shell

    - a portable awk, like nawk

    - and a standard make (e.g. bmake).

The Makefile is generated from the build.sh script on the top level directory,
the actions file loosely resemble noweb syntax and contain both commands and
documentation in plain text.

To list available targets/actions (e.g., make nofake):

    grep ^= actions
